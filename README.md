# A collection of some utility scripts

Userscripts enhance websites by extending or modifying certain behaviors or adding new features.  
They can be used with a userscript manager like [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) which is open source.

Scripts located within the [cheat-engine](cheat-engine/) directory are intended to be used with [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/).

## Installation

On GitHub, navigate to a script you want to install and open it. Then press the <kbd>raw</kbd> button.

This should automatically open the installation page of your userscript manager.

> [!NOTE]
> Some scripts require you to modify them slightly before you can use them.  
> E.g. inserting the url of your jira instance.

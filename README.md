# A collection of some convenience scripts

[Userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript) enhance websites by extending or modifying certain behaviors or adding new features.  
They can be used with a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).

Scripts located within the [cheat-engine](cheat-engine/) directory are intended to be used with [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/), and are not meant to be used on the web.

## Note

ðŸ“¢ Some scripts require you to modify them slightly before you can use them.  
E.g. inserting the url of your jira instance.

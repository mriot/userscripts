# pr0gramm - userscripts

## collection downloader

Downloads a full collection (e.g. your favorites), neatly organized into `sfw`, `nsfw`, `nsfl`, `nsfp` and `pol`  folders packed into a zip file.  

## usage

Navigate to a user's collection page (e.g. `pr0gramm.com/user/cha0s/favoriten`) and open the console (<kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>CTRL+SHIFT+I</kbd>).

You'll see a message like `Run downloadCurrentCollection() to start downloading`.  
Type the function name (including the parentheses) and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to start the download.

While the script is running, the console will show some log messages.

After the download is finished, a zip file will be generated and offered for download.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - In order to download `nsfw`, `nsfl`, etc. you need to be logged in
> - You can't download files from `/uploads`
> - Only works with public collections (or your own)
> - Intended for personal backups - don't use for mass downloading
> - Might get you banned if used excessively ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
